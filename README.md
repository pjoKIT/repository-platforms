# Overview of Existing (Metadata) Repository Platforms

Source of a living document/website about (metadata) repository platforms and their features.

If you are looking for a repository which provides support for a specific schema only, you might take a look at the Metadata Standards Catalogs:

- https://msc.datamanager.kit.edu
- https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk

There you might find a repository tailored for your specific needs.
